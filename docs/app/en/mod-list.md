# Mod List

Your installed mods: which ones are on and the order the game loads them in. Every change here is saved at once into the active profile and into `Zomboid/mods/default.txt`, the list the game reads.

## What you see

- The header counts Workshop items, mods, mods **active**, and map, library and script mods. Red and amber counters (**Dependencies missing**, **Dependencies off**, **Incompatibility**, **List Order**) appear when there is a problem; click one to jump through those mods.
- The toolbar: search, filters, groups, and the **Enable All** / **Disable All** buttons.
- The list. The green bar on top (**LOADS FIRST**) is where libraries go; the amber bar at the bottom (**LOADS LAST**) is where a mod wins any file two mods share.
- On the right, the inspector for the selected mod: its details, what it requires, and warnings with buttons (**Move After ...**, **Activate Library**, **Deactivate**).

## Support the author

The inspector shows **Support the author** with the links its author put in the mod's changelog or in its Workshop description (Ko-fi, Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee...), opened in your browser, and, when the mod ships a changelog, **Latest in its changelog**, which opens its newest entry. The same buttons are on a Workshop item's page in Browse, installed or not.

## The # column

The number on each row is the mod's place among the mods that are **on**: the load order the game reads, and the same number the game shows. A mod that is off shows **—** and the **OFF** tag, because it has no place in the load order. Off mods keep their spot in the list, so switching one on usually puts it back where it was.

## Turning mods on and off

- Click the square on a row, or right-click and choose **Switch on** / **Switch off**.
- When a mod needs other mods, a window lists what comes on with it (and what goes off with it). Choose **Switch on all N**, or **Only ...** for that one mod alone.
- **Enable All** and **Disable All** act only on the rows shown now (after search and filters), and ask first.
- An open draft package from the Mod Merger cannot be switched on until it is packaged.

## Changing the load order

- Drag a row by its number and drop it above or below another row. Hidden rows in between are respected.
- The arrow buttons on the right: move to top, up one, down one, move to bottom. Up and down swap with the next mod in the full list, which may be a mod that is off.
- **Pos #**: type a number and press **Go** or Enter. The mod goes to that place among the mods that are on.
- **Auto-Sort Dependencies**: puts each mod after what it requires and its `loadModAfter` mods, before its `loadModBefore` mods, and after the mods your own rules say. Everything else keeps your order; PZ Mod Studio packages go last. A window says how many mods moved, with **Undo**.

## Finding mods

- The search box matches the name, the mod id, the Workshop id and your notes.
- The filter buttons: **All**, **On**, **Off**, **Favourites**, **Updated**, **Problems**, **Maps**, **Libraries**, **Can't load**. Each shows its count.
- Below them: **Sort: load order** or **Sort: name**, the **Groups** menu, one of your groups, the source (**Steam Workshop**, **Your Workshop uploads**, **Installed by hand**, **Compatible copies**...), a tag (errors or warnings last session, slow to load, a Mod Health problem) and **Profile's mods** / **All installed**.
- The game's Mods screen (Studio Link mod) has the same filters in the same order. Updated, Libraries, the group, the source and the tag need PZ Mod Studio; without it the game says so where they would be.
- Dragging works sorted by name too: the mod goes to the place of the one you drop it on.
- **clear filters** shows every mod again.

## Groups and notes

- The **Groups** menu lays the list out in folding sections: **Groups: none**, **Groups: author**, **Groups: category** or **Groups: mine**. Each heading shows how many are on, with **All on** / **All off**. In **Groups: mine**, a note button edits the group's note.
- Right-click a mod and choose **Groups…** to tick the groups it is in, create a new one (**Add to it**), rename or delete one. A group left empty goes away. Groups never change the load order.
- Picking one of your groups shows **Turn the group on** (with what its mods require) and **Turn the group off**.
- Right-click and choose **Add a note…** to write a note on a mod. A note icon shows on its row.
- Each profile has its own groups: a group belongs to the profile you made it in. Notes are about a mod and the same in every profile.
- Notes and groups are yours only. The game shows them (the active profile's groups) on the Studio Link mod's Mods screen.

## The profile's mods

With a profile active, the list shows that profile's mods. The **Only (profile)** button switches to **Showing everything**, which lists every installed mod and tags each with the profiles it is in. Installed mods that are in no profile (subscribed from the Steam website, for example) get a blue bar with **Add to the profile** (they join switched off), **Show them**, or the X to hide it.

## The right-click menu

**Switch on/off**, **Add to the profile** / **Take out of the profile** (taken out also switches it off), **Move to the top**, **Move to the bottom**, **Open in Mod Browser**, **Open its folder**, **Add a note…**, **Groups…**, **Load-order rules…**, **Keep this version**, **Kept versions…**, **Favorite**, **Add to a list…**, **Add to a profile…**, **Share what the Studio saw of this mod…** and **Copy the mod id**.

- **Load-order rules…**: say a mod must load after another (things you found by playing). Auto-Sort follows the rule and Mod Health warns when the list breaks it. **Share this rule** offers it to the community on GitHub.
- **Keep this version** copies the mod as it is today to `Zomboid/PZModStudio_Snapshots`. **Kept versions…** lists the copies: **Use this version** puts one back as a local copy the game reads instead of the Workshop one.

## Row tags

Tags on a row come from the last session and Mod Health: errors or warnings the game logged for the mod, how long it took to load, and problems such as **Needs a mod that is off** or **Loads too early**. Click a tag to go to the related mod or to Mod Health; the wrench button next to it applies the fix.

## Earlier lists and presets

- **Earlier lists** is undo for the list. Each time the Studio wrote it, the previous one was kept. Pick one and press **Go back to this**; your current list is kept too.
- The **Presets** button saves the list as a named preset, loads one, or exports and imports `.pzpack` files. An imported pack lists the mods you lack, with **Subscribe to all**.

## Good to know

- **Refresh** scans the mod folders again after you subscribe or unsubscribe.
- The PZ Mod Studio Link mod stays on in every profile and is hidden from the list while a profile is active.
- While the game runs, changes made here reach it on the main menu (through the Studio Link mod), or with **Sync with PZ Mod Studio** on its Mods screen.
