# Contributing to Project Zomboid Mod Studio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Project Zomboid Mod Studio (PZ Mod Studio)**! 

PZ Mod Studio is a free, open-source community suite designed to solve mod conflicts, manage load orders, and diagnose runtime errors across Project Zomboid builds. We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug reports, polyfill rules, documentation, translations, and code improvements.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js**: v22 or newer ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Rust Toolchain**: Stable release ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Git**: ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Microsoft Edge WebView2**: Pre-installed on modern Windows 10/11.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pichu6/Project-Zomboid-Mod-Studio.git
cd Project-Zomboid-Mod-Studio
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run in Development Mode
Launch the application with live hot-reloading for both the React frontend and Tauri Rust backend:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### 4. Build Standalone Binaries
To compile the standalone release:
```bash
# Build production frontend and compile portable bundle
npm run build:portable
```

To compile only the standalone MCP Server (faster, no GUI):
```bash
cargo build --release --bin pz-mcp-server --manifest-path "src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
```

## 🎯 How You Can Contribute

### 1. 🛡️ Polyfill Rules for Build 42 Compatibility
If you encounter a specific API break between B41 and B42 (e.g., changed function signatures, moved require paths, or uninitialized global tables), you can contribute a new rule in `src/data/default_rules.ts`.

### 2. 🔀 Merge Engine & AST Improvements
Help refine the 3-Way AST parser (`src-tauri/src/diff_engine/lua.rs`) to handle complex table structures and edge-case Lua constructs.

### 3. 🌐 Internationalization / Translations
Help translate the UI into other languages (Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Chinese, etc.).

### 4. 🐧 Linux / Steam Deck Support
Help test and optimize path resolution and dedicated server tools on Linux and Proton.
