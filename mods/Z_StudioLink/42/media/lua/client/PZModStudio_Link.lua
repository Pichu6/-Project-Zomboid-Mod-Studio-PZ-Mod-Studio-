-- PZ Mod Studio Link: the game's Mods screen shows the profile that is active in PZ Mod Studio.

-- Files in Zomboid/Lua (the only folder the game's Lua can use), protocol 2:

--                                       (on or off, in load order), other=<mod id> per mod
--                                       another profile holds
--   PZModStudio_LinkHealth.txt    app:  <severity>\t<mod id>\t<text> per Mod Health warning, in
--                                       the player's language
--   PZModStudio_LinkApp.txt       app:  protocol, version, alive=<unix seconds>, every few
--                                       seconds while it runs
--   PZModStudio_LinkRequests.txt  this: <id>\t<verb>\t<argument> per request (add <mod id>)
--   PZModStudio_LinkAcks.txt      app:  <id>\tok|error\t<text> per request it handled
--   PZModStudio_LinkGame.txt      this: state=menu|ingame, save, mods, on entering either
--   PZModStudio_LinkScreen.txt    both: screen=studio|other|ask, other=<mod id>: which Mods
--                                       screen the player chose when another manager is on
--
-- What it does with them:
-- - Mods screen: only the profile's mods ("Show all subscribed mods" brings the rest back); a
--   button for mods installed but in no profile at all (new subscriptions), which adds them to
--   the profile; a mark on each mod Mod Health has something to say about, with the text on hover.
-- - Load screen: on each save, whether its mods match the profile.
-- - Loading a save: one that uses mods outside the profile does not load; one whose mod list is
--   empty asks first, and can be given the profile's mods.
-- Turning mods on or off here needs nothing from this mod: the game writes mods/default.txt and
-- the Studio reads it. Without the Link file (no profile active in the Studio) the game's screens
-- are left as they are.
